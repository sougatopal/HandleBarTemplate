Write a client side rendering Javascript/jQuery + HTML code to construct profile.html dynamically using data from profile.json. You can use any javascript templating library of your choice (handlebars.js, mustache.js, dust.js are some of them). The json file can be hosted on any HTTP server.

The javscript code must be well written (see points metioned below)

1. Readble and modular
2. Small size.
3. Should have fast page loads
